    "Q1: The main difference between a t-test and a z-test is in the scenarios in which they are used and the assumptions they make.\n",
    "\n",
    "T-test: A t-test is used when you want to compare the means of two groups or samples, and you do not know the population standard deviation. It assumes that the data follows a normal distribution or is approximately normally distributed. For example, you might use a t-test to compare the average test scores of two different classes of students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Z-test: A z-test is used when you want to compare a sample mean to a known population mean and you know the population standard deviation. It assumes that the data follows a normal distribution or is approximately normally distributed. For instance, you might use a z-test to determine if the average height of a sample of people is significantly different from the known average height of the entire population.\n",

    "One-tailed test: In a one-tailed test, you are testing a specific direction of an effect. For example, you might be interested in whether a new drug increases the average lifespan (specifically longer), so you conduct a one-tailed test looking for an effect in that direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two-tailed test: In a two-tailed test, you are testing for any significant difference without specifying a direction. For example, you might want to determine if a coin is biased (either it comes up heads more often or tails more often) compared to an unbiased coin.\n",

    "Q3:\n",

    "Type 1 error: This occurs when you reject a true null hypothesis. In other words, you conclude that there is an effect or difference when there isn't. An example could be a medical test falsely indicating a person has a disease when they do not.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type 2 error: This occurs when you fail to reject a false null hypothesis. In other words, you conclude that there is no effect or difference when there actually is. An example could be a medical test failing to detect a disease when the person is actually sick.\n",

    "Example: Suppose you want to estimate the average height of adult males in a city. You take a random sample of 100 adult males, measure their heights, and calculate a 95% confidence interval. The confidence interval might be: 175 cm ± 5 cm, meaning you are 95% confident that the true average height falls within the range of 170 cm to 180 cm.\n",

    "Q6: To use Bayes's Theorem to calculate the probability of an event occurring given prior knowledge and new evidence, you need the prior probability (P(A)), the probability of the evidence given the event (P(B|A)), and the probability of the evidence (P(B)).

You also know that when you randomly select a red marble, it turns green with a 10% chance (P(G|R) = 0.10), and when you randomly select a blue marble, it turns green with a 5% chance (P(G|B) = 0.05). If you randomly select a marble and it's green, you can use Bayes's theorem to calculate the probability that it was originally red (P(R|G)).\n",

    "Q8: The margin of error in a confidence interval is a measure of the uncertainty associated with the estimate. It depends on the confidence level and the standard error of the estimate. A larger sample size typically results in a smaller margin of error because larger samples provide more information and reduce sampling variability.\n",

If you take a small random sample of 20 households, the margin of error might be $1,000 at a 95% confidence level. If you increase the sample size to 200 households, the margin of error might decrease to $100 at the same confidence level, providing a more precise estimate.\n",
