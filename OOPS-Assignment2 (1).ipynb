    "3.The abc module in Python provides functionality for creating abstract base classes (ABCs) and interfaces. It allows you to define abstract classes and enforce a structure and behavior in derived classes. Abstract base classes cannot be instantiated directly and serve as blueprints for subclasses. The abc module enables the use of abstract methods, which subclasses must implement, ensuring required behavior. It also supports the creation of interfaces, defining a set of methods that implementing classes must adhere to. The abc module promotes code organization, consistency, polymorphism, and type checking in Python programs."

    "4.Data abstraction in object-oriented programming is achieved through techniques such as encapsulation, access modifiers, getters and setters, and abstraction layers. Encapsulation involves bundling data and related methods into a class, hiding the internal implementation details. Access modifiers control the visibility and accessibility of data members and methods. Getters and setters provide controlled access to private attributes, enabling validation and data manipulation. Abstraction layers organize classes into a hierarchical structure, with higher-level classes providing a generalized view and interacting with lower-level classes through well-defined interfaces. These techniques help in achieving data abstraction by emphasizing essential attributes and behaviors while hiding unnecessary details, promoting code organization, data integrity, and a higher level of abstraction."
