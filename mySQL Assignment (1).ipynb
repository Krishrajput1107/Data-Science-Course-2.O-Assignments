    "1.A database is a structured collection of data used to efficiently store, retrieve, modify, and manage information. There are two main types of databases: SQL and NoSQL databases. SQL databases are relational databases that store data in structured tables with predefined schemas, where relationships between tables are defined using keys. They ensure data integrity and consistency through ACID properties, making them suitable for applications with well-defined data relationships and transactional needs. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are non-relational and offer more flexibility in data models, storing data in various formats like key-value pairs, documents, columns, or graphs. They sacrifice ACID properties to achieve greater scalability and performance, making them ideal for handling large-scale, dynamic data in real-time web applications or projects with evolving data requirements. The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific characteristics and needs of the application being developed."

    "2.DDL (Data Definition Language) is a subset of SQL used to define and manage the structure of a database. It includes commands such as CREATE (for creating new objects like tables), DROP (for deleting objects), ALTER (for modifying objects), and TRUNCATE (for removing all data from a table). For example, CREATE is used to create tables with specified columns and data types, DROP deletes existing objects, ALTER modifies the structure of an object, and TRUNCATE removes all data from a table while keeping its structure. These DDL commands are essential for maintaining a well-organized and efficient database schema."

It includes three primary commands: INSERT (to add new records), UPDATE (to modify existing records), and DELETE (to remove unwanted records). For example, INSERT adds new data, UPDATE modifies existing data based on conditions, and DELETE removes specific data based on conditions. DML commands enable efficient data management and maintenance within database tables."

    "4.DQL (Data Query Language) is a subset of SQL used to retrieve data from a database. The primary command in DQL is SELECT, which allows you to query and fetch data from one or more database tables based on specified conditions. For example, the SELECT command retrieves specific columns from a table based on the given conditions. It plays a crucial role in extracting and presenting relevant information from the database for users or applications."
