    "1.Probability Mass Function (PMF) and Probability Density Function (PDF):\n",
    "\n",
    "PMF: The Probability Mass Function is used for discrete random variables. It assigns probabilities to each possible outcome. For example, when rolling a fair six-sided die, the PMF would specify that each outcome (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) has a probability of 1/6.\n",
    "\n",
    "PDF: The Probability Density Function is used for continuous random variables. It gives the density of probability at each point along the entire range of possible values. For instance, in the case of a standard normal distribution, the PDF specifies the probability density at any given point along the real number line.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Cumulative Density Function (CDF):\n",
    "\n",
    "The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) gives the probability that a random variable takes on a value less than or equal to a specific value. It provides a cumulative view of the probability distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the case of a fair six-sided die, the CDF at 3 would tell you the probability of rolling a 1, 2, or 3. The CDF is used to calculate cumulative probabilities and can be used to find percentiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Normal Distribution Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is used in situations where data tend to cluster around a central value with fewer extreme values as you move away from the center. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Heights of adults: Most people tend to be of average height, with fewer very tall or very short individuals.\n",
    "IQ scores: IQ scores are often normally distributed, with the majority of people clustering around the average IQ of 100.\n",
    "Errors in measurements: In scientific experiments, measurement errors often follow a normal distribution.\n",
    "The parameters of the normal distribution are the mean (μ) and the standard deviation (σ). The mean represents the center of the distribution, while the standard deviation controls the spread or variability. A larger standard deviation results in a wider, more spread-out distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Importance of Normal Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is important in statistics because of the Central Limit Theorem, which states that the distribution of the sample means of a sufficiently large number of independent, identically distributed random variables approaches a normal distribution, regardless of the original population distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-life examples of normal distribution include exam scores, heights, blood pressure measurements, and many other natural phenomena. It provides a powerful tool for data analysis and hypothesis testing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Bernoulli Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Bernoulli Distribution models a single trial with two possible outcomes, often labeled as \"success\" and \"failure.\" It's used to describe situations with binary outcomes, where the probability of success (denoted as p) is constant for each trial. For example, flipping a fair coin, where \"heads\" may represent success (p=0.5), can be modeled using a Bernoulli distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "Difference from Binomial Distribution: While both Bernoulli and Binomial distributions deal with binary outcomes, the main difference is that the Bernoulli distribution models a single trial, whereas the Binomial distribution models multiple independent Bernoulli trials. In essence, the Binomial distribution is the sum of multiple Bernoulli trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Probability of a Normally Distributed Observation:\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the probability that a randomly selected observation from a normally distributed dataset with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 10 is greater than 60, you can use the z-score formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "Z = (X - μ) / σ\n",
    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "\n",
    "X is the value (in this case, 60),\n",
    "μ is the mean (50), and\n",
    "σ is the standard deviation (10).\n",
    "Calculate the z-score:\n",
    "\n",
    "Z = (60 - 50) / 10 = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you can use a standard normal distribution table or calculator to find the probability associated with a z-score of 1, which is approximately 0.8413. So, the probability that a randomly selected observation is greater than 60 is 0.8413 or 84.13%.\n",
    "\n",
    "Uniform Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Uniform Distribution is characterized by a constant probability density over a specified range. All outcomes within the range are equally likely. An example is rolling a fair six-sided die, where each outcome (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) has an equal probability of 1/6.\n",
    "Z-Score and Its Importance:\n",
    "\n",
    "A Z-Score (or standard score) measures how many standard deviations a data point is from the mean in a normal distribution. It allows you to standardize data and compare values from different normal distributions. Z-scores are important for statistical analysis, hypothesis testing, and identifying outliers.\n",
    "Central Limit Theorem (CLT):\n",
    "\n",
    "The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the sample means of a sufficiently large number of independent, identically distributed random variables will be approximately normally distributed, regardless of the original population distribution. It is significant because it allows us to make statistical inferences about population parameters using sample data.\n",
    "Assumptions of the Central Limit Theorem:\n",
    "\n",
    "The random variables in the sample must be independent.\n",
    "The sample size should be sufficiently large (usually n > 30) for the CLT to apply.\n",
    "The population from which the samples are drawn does not need to be normally distributed. The CLT allows for non-normally distributed populations, as long as the sample size is large enough.\n",
    "The CLT is a fundamental concept in statistics, enabling the use of normal distribution-based techniques in various real-world applications, even when the original data may not follow a normal distribution."
