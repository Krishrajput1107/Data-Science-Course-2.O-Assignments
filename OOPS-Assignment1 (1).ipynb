    "1.In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or a template that defines the characteristics (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that an object of that class will have. It provides a structure for creating objects and defines the initial state and behavior common to all objects of that class. In simpler terms, a class can be thought of as a blueprint or a set of instructions for creating objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity or thing that can have its own unique state and behavior, as defined by the class it belongs to. Objects are created based on the structure defined by the class and can interact with each other by invoking methods and accessing attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example to illustrate this concept. Suppose we have a class called \"Car\" that represents a generic car. The class \"Car\" may have attributes such as \"color,\" \"brand,\" and \"year,\" which define the state or characteristics of a car. It may also have methods such as \"start_engine,\" \"accelerate,\" and \"stop,\" which define the behavior or actions a car can perform."
